He and I took a quick trip from #SF out to Yosemite so he could show me another beautiful climbing route with awesome mountaineering type scrambling at the top. The crest is about a mile long granite fin and is 10,923 feet in elevation. The route itself is 500 feet high. Matthes Crest is part of the Cathedral Range which is found inside of #yosemitenationalpark, part of the stunning Sierra Nevada. It's named after Fran√ßois Matthes, a cartographer and author who described the geology of the region. Do you love nature and the outdoors?
